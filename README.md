Personal Finance Tracker
Overview
Personal Finance Tracker is a full-stack financial planning and tracking application developed using Flutter and Python. Originally built to meet my own personal budgeting needs, it has since evolved into a scalable solution designed to help individuals and households manage their finances more effectively. The app supports budgeting, spending analysis, debt tracking, and financial reporting—all within a secure and user-friendly interface.
